\chapter*{Abstract}

We introduce classical linear logic, a substructural logic with a classical framework.
Then we explore classical processes, a prototypical concurrent language which presents 
classical linear logic as a session typed process calculus. We then provide a translation 
from the simply typed lambda calculus into classical processes with a proof of simulation. 
This can provide the logical foundation for an enhanced message passing concurrent programming 
language which makes use of session types to provide type checking.
